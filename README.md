# Ether API

This is a quick protoype backend API in which user can post a message into the "Ether". 

This is a going to be location based App. I would like to be able to get post a message and only folks within the radius from which the
message came from is able to see the message. Whenever you post a message, it will be saved into our database for a max of 24hrs. Then it will be deleted
from the database. There will be no data sent to a dataware house for analytics.

This readme will be updating from time to time.
